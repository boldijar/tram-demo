## Hi


## Retrofit &  tikxml
I've decided to use tikxml, because SimpleXML convertor got deprecated, and Jake Wharton recommended this [here](https://github.com/square/retrofit/issues/2733)

## Koin as DI framework
Because is easy and fast

## Architecture
MVVM, using ViewModels and data binding


## Other thoughts
* I've separated the android & UI related logic to the data logic in 2 modules
* I've decided to implement the function where I see which tram I should look for in a different class so I can also create some unit tests to be sure it's working
* Using material design because it looks awesome
